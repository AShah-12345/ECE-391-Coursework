# ECE-391-Coursework
MP (Machine Problems) from ECE 391: Computer Systems Engineering @ UIUC SP'24

Brief Overview:

MP1 Description:
Blink Driver

This project implements a Linux kernel module that handles blinking characters on a text-mode video screen using a Real-Time Clock (RTC) interrupt. The core functionality involves managing a linked list of custom structures to control the blinking of characters on-screen.

MP2 Description:
VGA Graphics and Text Mode Handling

This project involves a series of functions to manage VGA graphics and text modes, primarily aimed at creating a functional display for a maze game. 

MP3 Description:
Linux OS Core | C++, x86 AT&T ASM, QEMU, Gitlab, Intel IA-32 Architecture 
March 2024 - May 2024

• Designed core elements of a Linux-like OS with a multitasking kernel and protection mode, as part of a team of 4.

• Implemented memory paging and virtualization for 4MB virtual memory addressability and page-level protection.

• Developed file system driver functions for an in-memory filesystem and integrated process control block logic into system
calls, enabling user/kernel-level protection and associated privileges.

• Developed drivers for external devices, including the RTC and keyboard handler for terminal input.

• Integrated features such as user program execution, multitasking, pre-emptive scheduling, running three active shells, and
basic error handling.

• Authored extensive test cases to ensure functionality, utilizing knowledge of the Intel IA-32 Architecture SWD Manual.
